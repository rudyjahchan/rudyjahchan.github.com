    <p>Well so much for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> encouraging me to <a href="/2012/08/14/moved-from-wordpress-to-jekyll-part-1/">blog more</a>! But it has been a busy year since I got my site redesign up. Namely, my short film <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DNEDoNotErase">D.N.E.</a> won <a href="http://dailydragon.dragoncon.org/contests-awards/film-festival-award-winners/">BEST SCI-FI SHORT</a> at <a href="http://dragoncon.org/">Dragon*Con</a>, I got my U.S. Permanent residency, and, oh yeah, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseymckinnon/sets/72157632044476389/">I got married</a>.</p>
<p>But excuses aside! Let us delve into the technical details of my moving to Jekyll. Or if you want, <a href="#tldr">skip ahead</a>!</p>
<h2 id="migrating-my-old-posts">Migrating my old Posts</h2>
<p>Jekyll&rsquo;s documentation provides <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">two ways to migrate posts from Wordpress</a>. The first method was unfortunately a non-starter; the blog was being hosted on a shared server instance, which severely restricted my ability to install gems.</p>
<p>Instead, I went with generating an export file, functionality available in any Wordpress install, and running the &ldquo;wordpressdotcom&rdquo; migrator. This worked for the most part &hellip; Except for a bunch of bad character encodings in the posts!</p>
<p>Particularly line breaks, quotations, and other common characters were coming out all wrong. So wrong that Jekyll could not even start up properly! Using various <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1486493">sed</a> and <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20001206164827794">PERL</a> commands I managed to clean up most files.</p>
<p>Finally, as Google had already indexed my site, in order to ensure that search results did not lead to dead-links, I needed to maintain the paths of posts. This was done simply enough in the <code>config.yml</code>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=config.yml"></script>

<h2 id="stylishly-bootstrapping">Stylishly Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>Next up was laying out the site both structurally and design-wise. After many years of playing the CSS reset, redefine, and tweaking game, I was getting frustrated with having to establish on all the basic styles of a site over and over again, none of which turned out particularly well; you just have to take a look at <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast&rsquo;s</a> for proof.</p>
<p>Which is why <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> to developers like me. Yes, there have been many styling frameworks that provide grid layouts and other components. But Bootstrap goes beyond by establishing a decent, pleasant style.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind, I didn&rsquo;t avoid all the hard work. I still had to go through the &ldquo;tweak&rdquo; step, adding site specific styling behavior. Sometimes this was simply a matter of using the &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; class to get the behavior I wanted, like declaring the <code>&amp;lt;section /&amp;gt;</code> containing the content of posts a <code>hero-unit</code> to get the larger, readable font. Hackish I know, but it works.</p>
<p>But some behavior required a lot of labour. Particularly, while Bootstrap provides <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive">responsive functionality</a>, I spent a lot of time recreating the transforming navigation bar I had seen on other sites. Still, I can definitively say this would have been much harder without Bootstrap.</p>
<h2 id="responsive-video">Responsive Video</h2>
<p>Another responsive effect I wanted was to scale video to fill the width of the main column across any device. As many of you know, video has been a big part of my web-life, so showcasing on any platform was very important. Luckily, better people than me have <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-elastic-videos">already solved this problem</a>.</p>
<p>I added the following to my site CSS:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=responsive-video.css"></script>

<p>Then all I have to do for any video embed is ensure it&rsquo;s placed within a <code>div</code> tag with a <code>video</code> style class. Loverly.</p>
<h2 id="flying-without-plugins-and-databases">Flying without Plugins and Databases</h2>
<p>A big part of Wordpress&rsquo; appeal was the built-in commenting and the ability to extend functionality with plugins like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>. The flat-files Jekyll generates can&rsquo;t actually DO anything on the server side; can&rsquo;t store anything, can&rsquo;t process form responses, etc. Commenting is easily provided with <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> or <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Facebook</a>; I chose the former as I didn&rsquo;t want to favor any particular social network.</p>
<p>For my contact form I went with <a href="http://getsimpleform.com">Simpleform</a> which delivers exactly what its name promises. You signup with the email you want form data to be sent to, and you will receive  a token which you then pass back in the <code>action</code> path you submit the form to. And that&rsquo;s it! Any fields you place in your HTML form are captured with no further configuration. For example, here is my form:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=contact_form.html"></script>

<p>As for other functionality like sharing plugins, and auto-formatting? Well, the other benefit of moving to Jekyll hosted on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> was that alot of that stuff became difficult, if not impossible. Which made me realize that I really didn&rsquo;t need it in the first place. The goal, after all, was simplification.</p>
<h2 id="feeding-the-feeds">Feeding the Feeds</h2>
<p>Finally, as feeds are not automatically provided by Jekyll, I had to generate my own. Plenty of examples exist in the repos of other Jekyll based sites, including the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com">original</a>. Here is mine for RSS:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=rss.xml"></script>

<p>For Atom:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=atom.xml"></script>

<p>Additionally the site map for search engines:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/4142545.js?file=sitemap.xml"></script>

<p>Note in all cases the need to set <code>layout: nil</code> in the YAML front-matter. Otherwise, it would be wrapping them in the default layout of the site, which would produce invalid XML.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next?</h2>
<p>Well there you have it, some of the small tips and tricks I used in moving to Jekyll from my Wordpress install. What will I do next? I may try to re-introduce tags or categories to my posts. But in the meantime I am happy with what I have and look forward to get into the blogging groove.</p>
