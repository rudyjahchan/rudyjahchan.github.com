<p>Over two months ago, I was whining to <a href="http://www.jennipowell.com/">Jenni Powell</a> how I didn&rsquo;t get to collaborate anymore. So did the logical thing? Told me to shut up and invited me to guest-direct an episode of the horror-comedy show she produces called <a href="http://bumpsinthenight.tv">Bumps in the Night</a>.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for me, as I hadn&rsquo;t called the shots in over two years since we last produced <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast</a>, and this would be only the second time I directed somebody else&rsquo;s material (the first was an amazing screenplay that <a href="http://www.g14productions.com/">Matthew Balthrop</a> wrote for us). I learned (and re-learned) many things along the way, which will make for great future posts.</p>
<p>I have so many people to thank for this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenni Powell for inviting me in (hope she doesn&rsquo;t regret it too much)</li>
<li>The writers and stars of Bumps; Emmet Furey, John Reha, and Greg Benevent. You constantly surprised and amazed me with your delivery. We have to work together again sometime.</li>
<li>Our guest stars <a href="http://aprilbillingsley.com/">April Billingsley</a> and Daniel Weiss. Their patience and advice to this humble director was very much appreciated.</li>
<li>To editor Andrew Seeley; he was going to sit this one out as I rampaged through the editing, but came to our rescue when we needed him.</li>
<li>And finally, to my love, <a href="http://caseymckinnon.com/">Casey McKinnon</a>, not only for her cameo appearance(s), but for tolerating many super late nights of her frustrated guy focused on his computer instead of cuddling with her. You&rsquo;re the best.</li>
</ul>
