For the last two weeks a few of us here at Carbon Five Santa Monica explored our latest love, Virtual Reality, by creating a game from scratch.

<p>For the last two weeks a few of us here at Carbon Five Santa Monica explored our latest love, Virtual Reality, by creating a game from scratch. We had a hard time limit of two weeks and our team was small. Just <a href="http://bhavnadevani.com">Bhavna</a>, <a href="http://sidke.com/">Sidney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkithayer">Nicole</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/rudy">Rudy</a> working on a full game experience, with levels, sound and design.</p>
<p>This was completely an exercise in prioritization and exploration of a platform that only half the team had any experience with.</p>
<p>So, after just 10 working days, we present a variation of an 80&rsquo;s classic and favorite: <a href="http://carbonfive.github.io/vrogger">VRogger!</a></p>
<p>Tired of the hard-knock life of Frog City, you want to head off to the hills. Your only obstacle? The busy, deadly freeway in-between!</p>
<p>Built on <a href="http://aframe.io">A-Frame</a>, Vrogger is playable in browser, with VR support for <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Cardboard</a> with your Android and iOS browsers and Oculus through <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a> enabled browsers; just click the VR button in lower-right corner. Game-play is easy; tap the action button (lever on the side of a Cardboard or the spacebar on your keyboard) to jump straight up. Tap and hold to jump further. Lean forward, back, side-to-side to control the direction of your jump.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be writing more about our experience building Vrogger in the weeks to come, from why we went with A-Frame, how we applied our agile practices in its tight development, and other fun lessons learned along the way. In the meantime, check out <a href="http://github.com/carbonfive/vrogger">the codebase</a>.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think and <a href="http://www.carbonfive.com">get in touch</a> to learn more about our approach to development.</p>
