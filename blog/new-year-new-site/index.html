    <p>Hello, 2015! I love this time of year as another chance to kick-off new
endeavors. For me, it means refreshing my website and get back into
writing.</p>
<p>Many times in the best year, I&rsquo;ve thought &ldquo;I really should write a blog
post about that&rdquo; &hellip; and never did. There are the occasional
code-centric posts I&rsquo;ve written for <a href="http://carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a> but
at heart I am still a writer. Writers gotta write though, so this is my
go at it.</p>
<p>Going forward then, I&rsquo;ll be posting my thoughts under two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/tags/code/">Code</a> - tricks I&rsquo;ve picked up and ideas I&rsquo;m investigating in my
work with C5, <a href="http://craftcheckapp.com">Craft Check</a>, and even this site.</li>
<li><a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/tags/geek/">Geek</a> - reviews and reflections on comics, flicks, games, and more.
With original work thrown in now and then.</li>
</ul>
<p>So please stick around by following me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rudy">twitter</a>, subscribing to my
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/rudyjahchan">RSS feed</a>, or simply checking in on me now and then. And I always
love to hear back from you whether through comments or other means.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make 2015 a great one! [Insert obligatory Back to the Future II
joke here].</p>
