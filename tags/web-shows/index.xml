      <description>Over two months ago, I was whining to Jenni Powell how I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to collaborate anymore. So did the logical thing? Told me to shut up and invited me to guest-direct an episode of the horror-comedy show she produces called Bumps in the Night.
It was a great opportunity for me, as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t called the shots in over two years since we last produced Galacticast, and this would be only the second time I directed somebody else&amp;rsquo;s material (the first was an amazing screenplay that Matthew Balthrop wrote for us).</description>
