    <div class="article-content">  <p>Much of the magic of our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseymckinnon/sets/72157632044476389/">wedding</a> was due to the massive
pre-preparation of my brilliant and beautiful bride <a href="http://caseymckinnon.com">Casey McKinnon</a>;
I just stayed out of the way and lent a hand when asked. One of the many
great ideas she had was to have <a href="http://www.jonessoda.com/custom-labels">Jones Soda with custom labels</a>
as our wedding favors. It would be something different and hence
memorable.</p>

<p>We selected our flavors and found three pictures we felt
represented the depth and range of our relationship. Then came the fun
bit for me, the resident family writer: coming up with the label text.
On normal Jones bottles the label speaks of the quality ingredients that go
into the soda and blah blah blah whatever. I just relished the challenge
of coming up with fun little tales about the photo in 300 characters!</p>

<p>So for those who were unable to attend, here are the photos we used, the
labels I came up with, and the backstory behind each of them. Hope you
enjoy them.</p>

<h2 id="sugar-cane-cola">Sugar Cane Cola</h2>

<div class="img-inline"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rudyjahchan/mexican-cola.jpeg" alt="Sugar Cane Cola" /><div class="caption">Photo by <a href="http://jpd.me/">Jason DeFillippo</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a battle for the ages. Mexico's two greatest superheroes - El Luchadore and The Killer Bee - fought for days on end with a passion. A passion which turned to love for each other … and the refreshing taste of pure cane cola with no high-fructose corn syrup!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above photo was taken at the wedding-reception/Halloween-party of
our friends <a href="http://seanbonner.com">Sean Bonner</a> and <a href="http://taratigerbrown.com/">Tara "Tiger" Brown</a>. Casey and I went
with a "Mexican" theme; I was a luchadore and she was a "Killer Bee"
from the <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/1476">classic Saturday Night Live sketch</a>. We actually have this photo
framed in our home.</p>

<h2 id="root-beer">Root Beer</h2>

<div class="img-inline"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rudyjahchan/root-beer.jpeg" alt="Root Beer" /></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at the lovely couple. Don't they look wonderful? She's so pretty. And he … well, he's there. But behind those smiles lies a dirty secret. They were already married. Terrible, right? Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Which can be washed away with the medicinal sweetness of root beer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's true! Before our big wedding ceremony we actually had a quickie
earlier that year, mere weeks after <a href="http://youtu.be/-m2Yt1DcJi0">I proposed</a>. We kept it
quiet so as not to remove any "specialness" of the day we were sharing
with our family and friends.</p>

<h2 id="berry-lemonade">Berry Lemonade</h2>

<div class="img-inline"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rudyjahchan/berry-lemonade.jpeg" alt="Berry Lemonade" /><div class="caption">Photo by <a href="http://www.burmeisterphotography.com/">Mark Burmeister</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>That's not an "engagement photo" on this bottle. It's from our honeymoon. 
Our future selves accelerated it to 88mph and <strong>BLAM</strong> its back from our future.
Except we don't know where we're going; they cropped the photo too tight and blurred the background.
Jerks. At least berry lemonade is tasty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This photo actually was from our engagement photos … but though it was
technically BEFORE our wedding it 
was taken AFTER our first marriage ceremony as mentioned above!
The "timey-wimey" nature of all this (a subject <a href="http://timeywimey.tv">very dear to my heart</a>)
and the bright, almost radioactive blue shade of the drink
inspired the sci-fi tale in the label. Plus, hey, anyway to mention one of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054OGQOQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0054OGQOQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rudyjahchanco-20">the greatest movies
ever made</a>!</p>
