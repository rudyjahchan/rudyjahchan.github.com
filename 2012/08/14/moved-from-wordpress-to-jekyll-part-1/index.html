    <div class="article-content">  <p>Welcome to my redesigned website!</p>

<p>Many changes are abounding, not the
least of which is that I have moved off of using a self-hosted
<a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to having the site generated by 
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>  on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. 
It seems something of a tradition that the first post on a Jekyll
based site after such a move is to cover the whys and whatfors, so here
is my take on it!</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-wordpress">What's Wrong with Wordpress?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing. Everything.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the nearly 8 years(!!!) I have been using <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, it has grown in leaps
and bounds from a simple blogging platform into a fully extensible CMS.
It was/is my go-to platform for getting a site up for my creative
projects and for my friends and <a href="http://caseymckinnon.com">loved ones</a>.</p>

<p>But, personally, with that growth came a lot of headaches. Nearly every
time I created a site I would be writing my own themes, plugins and 
<a href="http://www.galacticast.com/2006/07/23/galacticast-secrets-multiple-video-formats-support-in-wordpress/">hacks</a>
to provide some extra desired bit of functionality. These would
become a hassle to maintain with each new version of Wordpress, as
functions I relied on would change. This problem also plagued plugins that I was using written by 
<em>others</em> and so would trigger even more cycles of work.</p>

<p>And here is the rub of it; <em>IT WAS ALL MY FAULT!!!</em></p>

<p>Given this great, flexible platform I went crazy, putting a lot of time
into building a site with a lot of features that were meant to save time 
- automatic video player generation, RSS media enclosures, etc - only to
spend a lot of more time keeping it working. Add to that ongoing issues with spam and security, 
warnings about resource usage, a distaste of PHP, and a growing need to go minimal in my life …
 and suddenly blogging became an unpleasent, cluttered experience.</p>

<p>It was time to move on.</p>

<h2 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h2>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> was first introduced to me by my <a href="http://carbonfive.com">Carbon
Five</a> colleague [Rit
Li][] when he heard me complaining about how long it took to simply save 
and preview a post<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, I did not appreciate the cold,
brusque responses my host gave when I reached out to them for help 
resolving these problems. Rit suggested switching to Jekyll and having my site <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">hosted on
Github for
<em>FREE</em></a>.
That piqued my interest and I read into it.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, you write your posts and pages as simple <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or HTML files, which are
then transformed using templates in those same formats, a process you
trigger from the command-line.</p>

<p>There is no database; the final result is simply dumped to your filesystem for you to do whatever you
wish whether browse it locally or upload to a server.</p>

<p>There is no theme sytem; you use straight CSS with some logic control through <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> tags.</p>

<p>There are plugins but that doesn't matter because <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, where I planned to host the
site, doesn't allow them anyway.</p>

<p>In brief; it's simple, fast, and limited.</p>

<p>Why is that a good thing?</p>

<p>Because it addressed my fundamental problem; given a wealth of options I
got distracted by using them. Here was a system restricted to very
simple functionality that required little to no resources except the developer
skills I was already familiar with.</p>

<p>I was sold. But there was a lot of work ahead of me.</p>

<h2 id="do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do">Do As I Say, Not as I Do</h2>

<p>Which brings me to one last thought…</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is not for everyone and it doesn't answer every need. I wouldn't
recommend it for anyone unfamiliar with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and basic command-line
usage. If my non-codemonkey friends ask me what should they run their
own sites on, I quickly say <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> or, if they have a
bit of money, <a href="http://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>.</p>

<p>But for me and my issues, it fits the bill. The fact that this site and
others have laid stagnant for a couple of years are a result of my laziness.
But when I did build up the willpower and login, suddenly noticing a bunch
of fixes and tweaks that needed attention did not help!</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is easy to maintain and
helps me focus on what it most important; <em>working my site's content
instead of its infrastructure!</em></p>

<p>My next post will cover some of the technical tips, tricks, and traps I
learned moving my site into <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I would love to hear your thoughts
or questions; post them here, message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rudy">Twitter</a> or feel free to
send an email; I am sure you can guess the address.</p>

available as plugins to Wordpress. But again, these plugins
themselves require maintenance!</li>
