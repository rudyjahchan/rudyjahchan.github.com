married</a>.</p>

<p>But excuses aside! Let us delve into the technical details of my moving
to Jekyll. Or if you want, <a href="#tldr">skip ahead</a>!</p>

<h2 id="migrating-my-old-posts">Migrating my old Posts</h2>

<p>Jekyll's documentation provides <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">two ways to migrate posts from
Wordpress</a>.
The first method was unfortunately a non-starter; the blog was
being hosted on a shared server instance, which severely restricted my
ability to install gems.</p>

<p>Instead, I went with generating an export file, functionality available
in any Wordpress install, and running the "wordpressdotcom" migrator. This
worked for the most part â€¦ Except for a bunch of bad character
encodings in the posts!</p>

<p>Particularly line breaks, quotations, and other
common characters were coming out all wrong. So wrong
that Jekyll could not even start up properly! Using various
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1486493">sed</a>
and
<a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20001206164827794">PERL</a>
commands I managed to clean up most files.</p>

<p>Finally, as Google had already indexed my site, in order to ensure that
search results did not lead to dead-links, I needed to maintain the paths
of posts. This was done simply enough in the <code>config.yml</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=config.yml">
</script>

<h2 id="stylishly-bootstrapping">Stylishly Bootstrapping</h2>

<p>Next up was laying out the site both structurally and design-wise. After
many years of playing the CSS reset, redefine, and tweaking game, I was
getting frustrated with having to establish on all the basic styles of
a site over and over again, none of which turned out particularly well;
you just have to take a look at <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast's</a>
for proof.</p>

<p>Which is why
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> to developers like me.
Yes, there have been many styling frameworks that provide grid layouts
and other components. But Bootstrap goes beyond by establishing a
decent, pleasant style.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind, I didn't avoid all the hard work. I still had to go
through the "tweak" step, adding site specific styling behavior.
Sometimes this was simply a matter of using the "appropriate" class to
get the behavior I wanted, like declaring the <code>&lt;section /&gt;</code>
containing the content of posts a <code>hero-unit</code> to get the
larger, readable font. Hackish I know, but it works.</p>

<p>But some behavior required a lot of labour. Particularly, while Bootstrap provides
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive">responsive
functionality</a>, 
I spent a lot of time recreating the 
transforming navigation bar I had seen on other sites. Still, I can
definitively say this would have been much harder without Bootstrap.</p>

<h2 id="responsive-video">Responsive Video</h2>

<p>Another responsive effect I wanted was to scale video to fill the width
of the main column across any device. As many of you
know, video has been a big part of my web-life, so showcasing on any
platform was very important. Luckily, better people than me have <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-elastic-videos">already
solved this
problem</a>.</p>

<p>I added the following to my site CSS:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=responsive-video.css"> </script>

<p>Then all I have to do for any video embed is ensure it's placed within a
<code>div</code> tag with a <code>video</code> style class. Loverly.</p>

<h2 id="flying-without-plugins-and-databases">Flying without Plugins and Databases</h2>

<p>A big part of Wordpress' appeal was the built-in commenting and the
ability to extend functionality with plugins like
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>. The
flat-files Jekyll generates can't actually DO anything on the server
side; can't store anything, can't process form responses, etc.
Commenting is easily provided with <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> or <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Facebook</a>; I chose
the former as I didn't want to favor any particular social network.</p>

<p>For my contact form I went with <a href="http://getsimpleform.com">Simpleform</a>
which delivers exactly what its name promises. You signup with the email
you want form data to be sent to, and you will receive  a token which 
you then pass back in the <code>action</code> path you submit the form to.
And that's it! Any fields you place in your HTML form are captured with
no further configuration. For example, here is my form:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=contact_form.html"> </script>

<p>As for other functionality like sharing plugins, and auto-formatting?
Well, the other benefit of moving to Jekyll hosted on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> was that
alot of that stuff became difficult, if not impossible. Which made me
realize that I really didn't need it in the first place. The goal,
after all, was simplification.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-the-feeds">Feeding the Feeds</h2>

<p>Finally, as feeds are not automatically provided by Jekyll, I had to
generate my own. Plenty of examples exist in the repos of other Jekyll
based sites, including the
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com">original</a>. Here is mine for RSS:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=rss.xml"> </script>

<p>For Atom:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=atom.xml"> </script>

<p>Additionally the site map for search engines:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4142545.js?file=sitemap.xml"> </script>

<p>Note in all cases the need to set <code>layout: nil</code> in the YAML
front-matter. Otherwise, it would be wrapping them in the default layout
of the site, which would produce invalid XML.</p>

<h2 id="next">Next?</h2>

<p>Well there you have it, some of the small tips and tricks I used in
moving to Jekyll from my Wordpress install. What will I do next? I may
try to re-introduce tags or categories to my posts. But in the meantime
I am happy with what I have and look forward to get into the blogging
groove.</p>

<h2 id="a-nametldr-atldr"><a name="tldr"> </a>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are many options to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">migrate Wordpress data</a>
but be prepared to fix the data.</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> provides a great foundation for responsive site design.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for commenting and <a href="http://getsimpleform.com">simpleform</a> for contact forms.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember to generate your own feeds; sample templates can be found in
multiple repos or <a href="https://gist.github.com/4142545">here</a></p>
