## [About](/about)

Rudy Jahchan has been producing popular web shows for the last five years, and creating code even longer than that. He is best known for the sci-fi comedy show <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast</a> and the review show <a href="http://acomicbookorange.com">A Comicbook Orange</a>. Rudy also develops software with the talented people of Carbon Five for a variety of platforms and clients.


<h3>Biography</h3>Rudyâ€™s fascination with the possibilites that emerge when mixing technology with storytelling at age 10 when he mistakenly picked up the Micro-Adventure book Space Attack (he thought it was going to be about Star Wars). That happy accident led him to graduate from McGill University in Computer Science and start a 12 year career in software development playing with a wide range of technology; everything from web applications to cryptology to NoSQL.

At the same time Rudy began working with his partner in all thing, <a href="http://caseymckinnon.com">Casey McKinnon</a> on a series of <a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/shows">web shows</a> that have garnered attention by mainstream media, awards and nominations, and most importantly by the fans who generate their millions of monthly views. Rudy and Casey have lectured at conferences from Podcamps to SXSW about how they accomplished all of this with two MacBooks, a camera, a roll of green construction, and a DIY spirit.

In 2008, he moved from Montreal to join Ruby and Java consulting shop <a href="http://www.carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a> at their Los Angeles office, and continues to pursue projects where he gets to hack together his passions of writing, directing, and coding into wonderful worlds for people to play in.
