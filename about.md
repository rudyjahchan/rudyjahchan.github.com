Rudy Jahchan has been producing popular web shows for the last six years, and creating code even longer than that.
He is best known for the sci-fi comedy show <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast</a> and the review show <a href="http://acomicbookorange.com">A Comicbook Orange</a>.
Rudy also develops software with the talented people of [Carbon Five](http://carbonfive.com) for a variety of platforms and clients.


<h3>Biography</h3>

Rudy's fascination with mixing technology and storytelling began at age 10 when he mistakenly picked up 
the Micro-Adventure book Space Attack (he thought it was going to be about Star Wars).

That happy accident led him to graduate from McGill University in Computer Science and start a 12 year career in 
software development playing with a wide range of technology; everything from web applications to cryptology to NoSQL.

At the same time Rudy began working with his partner in all things,
<a href="http://caseymckinnon.com">Casey McKinnon</a> on a series of <a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/shows">web shows</a>
that have garnered millions of monthly view and the attention by mainstream media, awards and (most important to him) the fans.
Rudy and Casey have lectured at conferences from Podcamps to SXSW about how they accomplished
all of this with two MacBooks, a camera, a roll of green construction, and a DIY spirit.

In 2008, he moved from Montreal to join agile consulting shop <a href="http://www.carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a> at their Los Angeles office,
working in Ruby, Node, iOS, Android, and more on exciting projects across many domains.

He continues to pursue his own works hacking together his passions of story-telling and coding into wonderful worlds for people to play in.
