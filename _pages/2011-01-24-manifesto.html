Manifesto is a minimalist <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> theme heavily based on the excellent <a href="http://jimbarraud.com/manifest/">Manifest</a> theme by <a href="http://jimbarraud.com/">Jim Barraud</a>. Following that themes highly readable format it introduces:
<ul>
	<li>HTML5 compatibility.</li>
	<li>Support for a single sidebar of widgets.</li>
	<li>Automatic shrinking of images in the main column to fit the 500 pixel width.</li>
	<li>Customizable navigation menus for the header and footer.</li>
	<li>Customizable header image.</li>
	<li>A "rich" description feature, to allow for HTML elements in the header description.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Customizable Header</h4>
Like other Wordpress themes with customizable header images, you can upload and crop the image through the Header link under the Appearances menu in your Wordpress dashboard. The image will not replace the text, but will be anchored to the lower right of the header area, right above the sidebar. The page width is 750 pixels, but you can upload an image smaller than that, as I did on my site; my headshot is 225 pixels wide to match the width of the siderbar.

<h4>Customizable Menus</h4>
Like other Wordpress themes with customizable menus, you can upload and crop the image through the Menus link under the Appearances menu in your Wordpress dashboard. Remember to save your menus as you edit them! If no custom menus are created, Manifesto defaults to displaying links to your Pages.

<h4>Rich Description</h4>
The standard description field for Wordpress does not currently support rich elements such as links or formatting (this actually makes sense as this description is used not only on your site but in other places where such elements would come out looking strange). Manifesto allows you to enter a "richer" description with such elements in it's Theme Options, under the Appearance Menu of your Wordpress dashboard. If no rich description is entered, it defaults to the standard description entered under the Settings page.
