Our Galacticast video [The Supermarios](http://www.galacticast.com/2007/03/06/the-supermarios/) was screened at the [Mississauga Independent Film Festival](http://miff.ca/) on Sunday, July 13th, at 11am in 
the [Short Progrm](http://miff.ca/?page_id=49) category. I would love to see some footage of this!

Special thanks to brothers-in-arms [Matt](http://mattcampagna.com/) and [Jeff Campagna](http://www.jeffcampagna.com/). Read of their awesomeness in [The Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080704.MIFF04/TPStory/TPEntertainment/Movies/).
