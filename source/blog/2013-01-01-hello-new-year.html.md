Happy New Year, all.

Last year was a good one for our household. I won the [IAWTV Awards for Non-Fiction Writing][iawtv-award].
Made a short film - [D.N.E][dne] - which won best sci-fi short at
[Dragon\*Con][dragon-con]. Was granted a green card, sponsored by my
wonderful workplace [Carbon Five][carbon-five]. And best of all, I
[proposed][proposal] and got [married][wedding] to the love of my life
[Casey McKinnon][casey-mckinnon]. Not too shabby.

So what to do this year? Well, let's start some resolutions.

1.  __Write a Novel__ There is a tale that has been brewing in me for
    a couple of year's now, that in my more innocent years (2010?) I
    thought could be a web series. But with the inspiration of my friend
    [Liz Shannon Miller][lizlet] publishing her own [book][liz-tells-frank],
    Casey putting out [Santa is an Atheist][santa-is-an-atheist], I am going
    to get it down and publish it.
1.  __Publish an App__ I am actually already working on a couple of
    things with the genius known as [Barrett Garese][barrett]. 
1.  __Run a Marathon__ I love running, when I do. It's just a matter of
    finding time. And with a year of experimentation, the best time
    seems to be early in the morning, on the way to work. It's not the best
    for getting some sun, but it is the best for getting it done.
1.  __Learn to Fight__ Tied with running is learning new skills. And
    this year it's going to be fighting. I'm going to stop wasting a
    Krav Maga membership. And I'm going to learn to sword-fight, if
    only to be better prepared for [CLANG!][clang]
1.  __Contribute Code__ As passionately as I love writing, I love coding,
    and I am lucky enough to get paid for it. And yet I've been very shy
    about showing my code. Mostly because I KNOW it's not the best. But I am
    beginning to believe it's good enough. So I'll be maintaining a couple
    of repos as well as helping making pull requests on [Github][github].
1.  __Bonsai my Social Network__ Finally, I count among the blessings I have
    in my life the many, many friends I have made and all the
    ways I can reach out to them. But I have to do a better job of
    maintaining that tree, not only in ensuring it brings good things to me,
    but more importantnly that it brings good things to my friends.
    Tomorrow, I am setting some ground rules for myself to make that happen.

So there you have it. Six "simple" resolutions to abide by. What are
yours?
