Hello, 2015! I love this time of year as another chance to kick-off new
endeavors. For me, it means refreshing my website and get back into
writing.

Many times in the best year, I've thought "I really should write a blog
post about that" ... and never did. There are the occasional
code-centric posts I've written for [Carbon Five][] but
at heart I am still a writer. Writers gotta write though, so this is my
go at it.

Going forward then, I'll be posting my thoughts under two categories:

* [Code][] - tricks I've picked up and ideas I'm investigating in my
work with C5, [Craft Check][], and even this site.
* [Geek][] - reviews and reflections on comics, flicks, games, and more.
With original work thrown in now and then.

So please stick around by following me on [twitter][], subscribing to my
[RSS feed][], or simply checking in on me now and then. And I always
love to hear back from you whether through comments or other means.

Let's make 2015 a great one! \[Insert obligatory Back to the Future II
joke here].
