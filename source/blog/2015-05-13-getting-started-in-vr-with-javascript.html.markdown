Virtual Reality is something we at [Carbon Five](http://carbonfive.com) have been playing around with the past few months, learning not only how to get started but how we can use our current toolset to work within the growing field. That's why I was excited two weeks ago to give a talk on getting started in virtual reality through JavaScript and [WebVR](http://mozvr.com) at [EmpireJS](http://empirejs.org/) in New York. We all had a fun time while I (wearing a TRON hoodie and Snow Crash referencing tee) walked through what we've learned while cracking jokes about Lawnmower Man and the 90s obsession with VR.

The video of the talk is available above (thanks to the EmpireJS crew for it and being incredible hosts) and the slide deck is available below. Try out demos on our VR demo site [c5vr.com](http://c5vr.com) with all the code being available through the [site's repository](https://github.com/carbonfive/c5vr).

Finally, we're holding [a workshop in our Santa Monica office](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/getting-started-in-vr-tickets-16969341758) walking through the same concepts for the Android platform, using Google Cardboard and Unity on Wednesday May 20th at 7:00pm PDT. For $15 you get one of the limited spots and your own take-home headset so if you're interested, [please register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/getting-started-in-vr-tickets-16969341758)!
