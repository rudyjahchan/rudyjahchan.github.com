Welcome to my redesigned website!

Many changes are abounding, not the
least of which is that I have moved off of using a self-hosted
[Wordpress][] to having the site generated by 
[Jekyll][]  on [Github][]. 
It seems something of a tradition that the first post on a Jekyll
based site after such a move is to cover the whys and whatfors, so here
is my take on it!

## What's Wrong with Wordpress?

In the nearly 8 years(!!!) I have been using [Wordpress][], it has grown in leaps
and bounds from a simple blogging platform into a fully extensible CMS.
It was/is my go-to platform for getting a site up for my creative
projects and for my friends and [loved ones](http://caseymckinnon.com).

But, personally, with that growth came a lot of headaches. Nearly every
time I created a site I would be writing my own themes, plugins and 
[hacks](http://www.galacticast.com/2006/07/23/galacticast-secrets-multiple-video-formats-support-in-wordpress/)
to provide some extra desired bit of functionality. These would
become a hassle to maintain with each new version of Wordpress, as
functions I relied on would change. This problem also plagued plugins that I was using written by 
_others_ and so would trigger even more cycles of work.

And here is the rub of it; _IT WAS ALL MY FAULT!!!_

Given this great, flexible platform I went crazy, putting a lot of time
into building a site with a lot of features that were meant to save time 
- automatic video player generation, RSS media enclosures, etc - only to
spend a lot of more time keeping it working. Add to that ongoing issues with spam and security, 
warnings about resource usage, a distaste of PHP, and a growing need to go minimal in my life ...
 and suddenly blogging became an unpleasent, cluttered experience.

It was time to move on.

## Why Jekyll?

[Jekyll][] was first introduced to me by my [Carbon
Five](http://carbonfive.com) colleague [Rit
Li][] when he heard me complaining about how long it took to simply save 
and preview a post<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, I did not appreciate the cold,
brusque responses my host gave when I reached out to them for help 
resolving these problems. Rit suggested switching to Jekyll and having my site [hosted on
Github for
_FREE_](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages).
That piqued my interest and I read into it.

In [Jekyll][], you write your posts and pages as simple [Markdown][] or HTML files, which are
then transformed using templates in those same formats, a process you
trigger from the command-line.

There is no database; the final result is simply dumped to your filesystem for you to do whatever you
wish whether browse it locally or upload to a server.

There is no theme sytem; you use straight CSS with some logic control through [Liquid][] tags.

There are plugins but that doesn't matter because [Github][], where I planned to host the
site, doesn't allow them anyway.

In brief; it's simple, fast, and limited.

Why is that a good thing?

Because it addressed my fundamental problem; given a wealth of options I
got distracted by using them. Here was a system restricted to very
simple functionality that required little to no resources except the developer
skills I was already familiar with.

I was sold. But there was a lot of work ahead of me.

## Do As I Say, Not as I Do

Which brings me to one last thought...

[Jekyll][] is not for everyone and it doesn't answer every need. I wouldn't
recommend it for anyone unfamiliar with [git][] and basic command-line
usage. If my non-codemonkey friends ask me what should they run their
own sites on, I quickly say [Wordpress][] or, if they have a
bit of money, [Squarespace][].

But for me and my issues, it fits the bill. The fact that this site and
others have laid stagnant for a couple of years are a result of my laziness.
But when I did build up the willpower and login, suddenly noticing a bunch
of fixes and tweaks that needed attention did not help!

[Jekyll][] is easy to maintain and
helps me focus on what it most important; _working my site's content
instead of its infrastructure!_

My next post will cover some of the technical tips, tricks, and traps I
learned moving my site into [Jekyll][]. I would love to hear your thoughts
or questions; post them here, message me on [Twitter][] or feel free to
send an email; I am sure you can guess the address.

1.  I am aware of the various caching solutions
    available as plugins to Wordpress. But again, these plugins
    themselves require maintenance!
