For the last two weeks a few of us here at Carbon Five Santa Monica explored our latest love, Virtual Reality, by creating a game from scratch. We had a hard time limit of two weeks and our team was small. Just [Bhavna](http://bhavnadevani.com), [Sidney](http://sidke.com/), [Nicole](https://twitter.com/nikkithayer), and [Rudy](https://twitter.com/rudy) working on a full game experience, with levels, sound and design.

This was completely an exercise in prioritization and exploration of a platform that only half the team had any experience with.

So, after just 10 working days, we present a variation of an 80's classic and favorite: [VRogger!](http://carbonfive.github.io/vrogger)

Tired of the hard-knock life of Frog City, you want to head off to the hills. Your only obstacle? The busy, deadly freeway in-between!

Built on [A-Frame](http://aframe.io), Vrogger is playable in browser, with VR support for [Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) with your Android and iOS browsers and Oculus through [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) enabled browsers; just click the VR button in lower-right corner. Game-play is easy; tap the action button (lever on the side of a Cardboard or the spacebar on your keyboard) to jump straight up. Tap and hold to jump further. Lean forward, back, side-to-side to control the direction of your jump.

We'll be writing more about our experience building Vrogger in the weeks to come, from why we went with A-Frame, how we applied our agile practices in its tight development, and other fun lessons learned along the way. In the meantime, check out [the codebase](http://github.com/carbonfive/vrogger).
