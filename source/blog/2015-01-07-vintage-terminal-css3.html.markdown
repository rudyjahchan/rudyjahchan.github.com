In addition to moving from Jekyll to [Middleman][middleman] for this
site, I also wanted to do something special. Something that represented
my quirky, geeky, 80s loving, hacker side instead of yet another
[Bootstrap][bootstrap] styled blogging site. I debated between swiping
[Oran Looney's][oran-looney] [Tron][sassy-tron] theme and one point
considered making my entire site act like a [console][demo-console]
like [Anders Evenrud's][anders-evenrud] demo. However, this could be a
huge drain on the resources of any reader's browsers, especially those
on mobile devices.

These issues were being bemoaned to my love [Casey McKinnon][casey] and
my bud Paul right before a screening of Blade Runner: Director's Cut.
They promptly told me to shutup and provided the obvious answer. Just
style my header! Which is exactly what I did if you cast your eyes to
the top of my site. Or see the demo below (for my dear feed readers):

<iframe width="100%" height="100" src="http://jsfiddle.net/rudyjahchan/qmjg92gq/embedded/result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Technical details on how I accomplished it can be found in [this post I
did on the Carbon Five blog][c5-blog-post]. I do want to say I sit on the shoulders of
giants, in this case Anders Evernud and [Lea Verou][verou]. And once
more thanks for the inspiration Paul and Casey!
