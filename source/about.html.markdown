Rudyâ€™s fascination with mixing technology and storytelling began at age 10 when he mistakenly picked up the Micro-Adventure book Space Attack (he thought it was going to be about Star Wars).

That happy accident led him to graduate from McGill University in Computer Science and start a career in software development playing with a wide range of technology; everything from web applications to cryptology to NoSQL. Since 2008, he has been leading teams for agile consulting shop [Carbon Five](http://carbonfive.com) at their Santa Monica office, working on exciting projects in Ruby, Node.js, iOS, Android, and more.

At the same time, Rudy has worked on many side-projects. He is best known as co-creator of the web series [Galacticast](http://galacticast.com) and [A Comicbook Orange](http://acomicbookorange.com) and the mobile app [Craft Check](http://craftcheckapp.com). Between them, they have garnered millions of downloads, the attention of mainstream media, awards and fans.

He continues to hack together his passions of story-telling and coding into wonderful worlds for people to play in.
