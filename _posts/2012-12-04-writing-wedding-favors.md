Much of the magic of our [wedding][] was due to the massive
pre-preparation of my brilliant and beautiful bride [Casey McKinnon][];
I just stayed out of the way and lent a hand when asked. One of the many
great ideas she had was to have [Jones Soda with custom labels][]
as our wedding favors. It would be something different and hence
memorable.

We selected our flavors and found three pictures we felt
represented the depth and range of our relationship. Then came the fun
bit for me, the resident family writer: coming up with the label text.
On normal Jones bottles the label speaks of the quality ingredients that go
into the soda and blah blah blah whatever. I just relished the challenge
of coming up with fun little tales about the photo in 300 characters!

So for those who were unable to attend, here are the photos we used, the
labels I came up with, and the backstory behind each of them. Hope you
enjoy them.

## Sugar Cane Cola

Photo by [Jason DeFillippo][]
<div class="hero-unit">
<p>It was a battle for the ages. Mexico's two greatest superheroes - El Luchadore and The Killer Bee - fought for days on end with a passion. A passion which turned to love for each other ... and the refreshing taste of pure cane cola with no high-fructose corn syrup!</p>
</div>

The above photo was taken at the wedding-reception/Halloween-party of
our friends [Sean Bonner][] and [Tara "Tiger" Brown][tara-brown]. Casey and I went
with a "Mexican" theme; I was a luchadore and she was a "Killer Bee"
from the [classic Saturday Night Live sketch][killer-bees]. We actually have this photo
framed in our home.

## Root Beer

![Root Beer][]
<div class="hero-unit well-small">
<p>Look at the lovely couple. Don't they look wonderful? She's so pretty. And he ... well, he's there. But behind those smiles lies a dirty secret. They were already married. Terrible, right? Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Which can be washed away with the medicinal sweetness of root beer.</p>
</div>

It's true! Before our big wedding ceremony we actually had a quickie
earlier that year, mere weeks after [I proposed][proposal]. We kept it
quiet so as not to remove any "specialness" of the day we were sharing
with our family and friends.

## Berry Lemonade

Photo by [Mark Burmeister][]
<div class="hero-unit">
<p>That's not an "engagement photo" on this bottle. It's from our honeymoon. 
Our future selves accelerated it to 88mph and <em>*BLAM*</em> its back from our future.
Except we don't know where we're going; they cropped the photo too tight and blurred the background.
Jerks. At least berry lemonade is tasty.</p>
</div>

This photo actually was from our engagement photos ... but though it was
technically BEFORE our wedding it 
was taken AFTER our first marriage ceremony as mentioned above!
The "timey-wimey" nature of all this (a subject [very dear to my heart][timey-wimey-tv])
and the bright, almost radioactive blue shade of the drink
inspired the sci-fi tale in the label. Plus, hey, anyway to mention one of [the greatest movies
ever made][back-to-the-future]!
