I was lucky enough to sit among the many brilliant minds at this session of New Mediacracy. Chris McCaleb and I talked about why we love doing these, and it like verbal 
jazz sessions, where we all riff off of each others' thoughts. I tried weakly comparing this episode to Led Zeppelin's No Quarter. Yeah, I know, that's quite a stretch.</p>

> It's a lively one, and a bigger group than usual joins us on this episode, which we recorded immediately after the first Los Angeles meeting of the <a href="http://iawtv.org">IAWTV</a> which took place at the <a href="http://wga.org">WGA</a>.  <a href="http://twitter.com/metonyv">Tony Valenzuela</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/caseymckinnon">Casey McKinnon</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/spytap">Barrett Garese</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/brettregister">Brett Register</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/rudy">Rudy Jahchan</a> join regulars <a href="http://twitter.com/chrismccaleb">Chris McCaleb</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zadi">Zadi Diaz</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/stevewoolf">Steve Woolf</a> to share their thoughts on the meeting and what it means for the future of the first organized member body dedicated to web video.

> We spend some time talking about the <a href="http://streamys.org">Streamys</a>, but a lot more time talking about the things we took away from the meeting and what the ramifications are for everyone invested in making web video a sustainable, progressive medium.  Also, we drink wine and laugh a lot.

> Most importantly, listen and leave a comment so we can get some outside feedback on the topics we discuss, such as the idea of the new gatekeepers, why we are trying so hard to replicate tv and film models, the vision of the IAWTV, and Chris McCaleb jumping out of planes.
