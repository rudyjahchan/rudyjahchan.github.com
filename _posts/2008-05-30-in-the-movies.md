A few days after [Casey](http://www.caseymckinnon.com/2008/05/26/now-on-imdb/) I too am now listed on IMDB. It's for our cameo appearance in [Six Reasons Why](http://www.sixreasonswhy.com/), the post-apocalyptic spaghetti western love song to Sergio Leone by the talented Campagna brothers.

Now to fill that listing up with more roles.
