    <p>Rudy’s fascination with mixing technology and storytelling began at age 10 when he mistakenly picked up the Micro-Adventure book Space Attack (he thought it was going to be about Star Wars).</p>
<p>That happy accident led him to graduate from McGill University in Computer Science and start a career in software development playing with a wide range of domains; everything from front-end web and mobile applications to backend systems, from procedural to reactive programming, from startup to enterprise. For 12 years he led teams at agile consulting shop <a href="http://carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a> from their Santa Monica office, working on exciting projects in Ruby, Node.js, iOS, Android, and more. Starting in July 2020, he took a leap into the gaming industry and joined <a href="https://riotgames.com">Riot Games</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rudy has worked on many side-projects. He is best known as co-creator of the web series <a href="http://galacticast.com">Galacticast</a> and <a href="http://acomicbookorange.com">A Comicbook Orange</a> and the mobile app <a href="http://craftcheckapp.com">Craft Check</a>. Between them, they have garnered millions of downloads, the attention of mainstream media, awards and fans.</p>
<p>It should come as no suprise Rudy is an avid player of table-top games, especially role-playing games. He also follows the worlds of immersive theater and mixed reality and plans on using them to hack together his passions of story-telling and coding into wonderful worlds for people to play in.</p>
