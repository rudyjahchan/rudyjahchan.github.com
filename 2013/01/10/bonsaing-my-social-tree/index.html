    <div class="article-content">  <p>One of my <a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/2013/01/01/hello-new-year/">New Year's resolutions</a> was to "bonsai" my social
tree. This goes beyond cutting swathes of people, friends, fans, or
what-have-yous from my social networks, which is why I didn't call this
post "Pruning my Social Trees". For while I do agree with the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar Number</a>, the needs of a content creator requires 
us to find a balance between staying connecting with initimates and
being able to reach an audience.</p>

<p>Why bother to do this at all, though? To belabor the "tree" metaphor, 
without proper maintenance your social tree will wither. My own situation 
demonstrates this. In the madgrab of "building an audience" I've added too many
branches to the point that I no longer see the roots of the whole thing. Automatic
reposting has resulted in the same item being listed multiple
times on the same network. And more importantly I am doing a terrible
job of feeding content into the tree, whether creating my own or sharing
from my friends.</p>

<p>So I decided to take action.</p>

<p>First, I am going do a better job of creating more content,
whether its code, stories, or posts. More importantly, I will more
actively support the works of my friends and peers.</p>

<p>Second, I decided the "role" each network plays; what
content I expect to see and post there and how it interacts with other
networks. Decisions were also made on who to follow and cuts made
without any malicious intent; I am not adverse to anyone requesting to
join my network, just as long as they do so on the right one. For my
part, when I have no expectations when I make a request and don't
campaign for a connection; I expect most peope are the same.</p>

<p>Some networks are "roots", the primary point for each piece
of work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://path.com">Path</a> is going to be my <em>private</em> life. I'm only <em>try</em> 
to follow my closest friends and family there, and am honored when 
they let me. In exchange, I will never campaign about
my projects here except to celebrate or vent any related emotions. It
will never repost to another network.</li>
  <li><a href="http://instagram.com/rudyjahchan">Instagram</a>, despite the privacy and rights brou-ha-ha a
few weeks ago, is still my main real-time, in-the-moment chronicle of my
<em>public</em> life and the behind the scenes of whatever I am working on.
It will post to most of the other networks, and I'll
be following mainly people I know whose
adventures I find entertaining.</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rudyjahchan">Github</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan">Gist</a> is where my code monkey activities
resides, with anything notable being highlighed as a post on the
<a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com">Carbon Emmiter</a>. I will be promoting these on other
networks as well.</li>
  <li>Like Charlie Brown trying to kick that damn football, I keep trying to
get into shape, and I've found the best network to track that has been
<a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/profile/rudyjahchan/">Nike+</a>. It's been set to automatically post achievements
to other networks.</li>
  <li>And of course, there is this <a href="http://rudyjahchan.com/blog/">blog</a>,
<a href="http://timeywimey.tv">Timey Wimey TV</a> and my other creative works that you
can specifically follow if you are interested, though you can expect to
see them mentioned alot elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The roots feed into "trunks", the popular mainstays we are all
familar with. I expect to see people sharing here, campaigning for their
own works, and generally making a spectacle of their lives; I know
I will!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rudyjahchan/">LinkedIn</a> is promoted to my preferred "networking"
network. If we've chatted at a meetup or you want to pitch a project to
me, this is how to reach me. I will respond, I promise. It may not be
affirmative to going forward at this time, but I <em>WILL</em> respond.</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/rudy">Twitter</a> is probably my favorite network, and could be a
"root" in its own right as I post statuses and observations there. I
follow people who continually delight and entertain me as real friends
or thought leaders. It's the zeitgeist of my world.</li>
  <li><a href="http://facebook.com/rudyjahchan">Facebook</a> will see the most change as I move a lot of
people into subscribers and track friends and families there from all
walks of life. My posts will be public, however, open to commentary though
messaging is reserved for people I actually know and have met.</li>
</ul>

<p>Others networks I consider "leafs", usually an endpoint of themselves
that can occassionaly give back to the whole tree.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://pinterest.com/rudyjahchan/">Pinterest</a> has surprised even me in how much I use it.
It's my moodboard that I mostly do for myself, and where I snapshot
things I want to keep long term to reference and inspire me. I've been
posting back to other networks as well, but trust me when I say I try to
be judicious of when I do so.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderonin/">Flickr</a> came roaring back this year at an opportune time and
I played around with the iOS app for a week as an Instagram replacement.
And while it was very shiny, its lack of automatic updating keeps it as
an archive of my photos, though I will be interacting more there in the
future.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there are the "buds", networks I am still trying to decide what I
am doing with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://plus.google.com/102403331307606219198/posts">Google Plus</a> shows a lot of promise, and I've been
trying to form circles around areas of interest. It may take the role of
a Facebook equivalent with more public interaction but I want to get
into the habit of regularly posting there first.</li>
  <li>To be honest, <a href="http://rudy.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is something I am still trying to
"get". There is clearly a language of memes that is used to communicate
there that I need to learn.</li>
  <li>Hearing that all the kids are hopping on [snapchat][snapchat], this
old man hopped on to figure out a way to use it â€¦ and is waiting for
someone he knows to show up!</li>
  <li>And I've also been making a daily post to <a href="http://www.chee.rs/">Chee.rs</a>, a
place to share appreciation of people, places and things some friends of
mine have launched.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, as this is about "social" platforms, you play a part in this
process. I encourage you to connect to me on the networks you prefer
and, more importantly, <em>disconnect</em> from those where it will be
redundent or irrelevant, even if that means all of them. No ill will be
taken or given as it is all about building real healthy relationships.
And this process should de done continually, as like a living tree, our
networks are continually growing and changing.</p>

<p>So what are your thoughts on this matter? I would love to hear them
below, or on any of the networks listed above!</p>
