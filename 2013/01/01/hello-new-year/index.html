    <div class="article-content">  <p>Happy New Year, all.</p>

<p>Last year was a good one for our household. I won the <a href="http://youtu.be/NxvOVZvsrA0?t=58m">IAWTV Awards for Non-Fiction Writing</a>.
Made a short film - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNEDoNotErase">D.N.E</a> - which won best sci-fi short at
<a href="http://dailydragon.dragoncon.org/contests-awards/film-festival-award-winners/">Dragon*Con</a>. Was granted a green card, sponsored by my
wonderful workplace <a href="http://carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a>. And best of all, I
<a href="http://youtu.be/-m2Yt1DcJi0">proposed</a> and got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseymckinnon/sets/72157632044476389/">married</a> to the love of my life
<a href="http://caseymckinnon.com">Casey McKinnon</a>. Not too shabby.</p>

<p>So what to do this year? Well, let's start some resolutions.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Write a Novel</strong> There is a tale that has been brewing in me for
a couple of year's now, that in my more innocent years (2010?) I
thought could be a web series. But with the inspiration of my friend
<a href="http://lizlet.tumblr.com/">Liz Shannon Miller</a> publishing her own <a href="http://liztellsfrank.com/book/">book</a>,
Casey putting out <a href="http://santaisanatheist.caseymckinnon.com/">Santa is an Atheist</a>, I am going
to get it down and publish it.</li>
  <li><strong>Publish an App</strong> I am actually already working on a couple of
things with the genius known as <a href="http://barrettgarese.com">Barrett Garese</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Run a Marathon</strong> I love running, when I do. It's just a matter of
finding time. And with a year of experimentation, the best time
seems to be early in the morning, on the way to work. It's not the best
for getting some sun, but it is the best for getting it done.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to Fight</strong> Tied with running is learning new skills. And
this year it's going to be fighting. I'm going to stop wasting a
Krav Maga membership. And I'm going to learn to sword-fight, if
only to be better prepared for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang">CLANG!</a></li>
  <li><strong>Contribute Code</strong> As passionately as I love writing, I love coding,
and I am lucky enough to get paid for it. And yet I've been very shy
about showing my code. Mostly because I KNOW it's not the best. But I am
beginning to believe it's good enough. So I'll be maintaining a couple
of repos as well as helping making pull requests on <a href="http://github.com/rudyjahchan">Github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonsai my Social Network</strong> Finally, I count among the blessings I have
in my life the many, many friends I have made and all the
ways I can reach out to them. But I have to do a better job of
maintaining that tree, not only in ensuring it brings good things to me,
but more importantnly that it brings good things to my friends.
Tomorrow, I am setting some ground rules for myself to make that happen.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there you have it. Six "simple" resolutions to abide by. What are
yours?</p>
