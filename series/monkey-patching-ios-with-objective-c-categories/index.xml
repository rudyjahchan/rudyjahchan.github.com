Have you ever wanted to introduce new functionality to base classes in the iOS SDK? Or just make them work a little differently? In order to do so, you must enter the wild and dangerous world of monkey-patching.
In this series of posts, we&amp;rsquo;ll show how to monkey-patch in Objective-C through categories to add and change methods, to add new instance variables and properties, and introduce swizzling, a technique that allows us to extend and preserve existing functionality.</description>

Have you ever wanted to introduce new functionality to base classes in the iOS SDK? Or just make them work a little bit differently? In order to do so, you must enter the wild and dangerous world of monkey-patching.
Monkey-patching is extending or modifying the behavior of code at runtime without changing its original source code. You can monkey-patch any code, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s your own code or not.</description>
